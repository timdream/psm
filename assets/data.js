With rapid-fire visuals, he shows how the funding process weakens the Republic in the most fundamental way, and issues a rallying bipartisan cry that will resonate with many in the U.S. and beyond.",

      "description": "Israeli Palestinian conflict explained: an animated introduction Israel and Palestine \n\nEasy to understand, historically accurate https://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/ mini- primer about why Israelis and Palestinians are fighting, why the US-backed peace process has been an impediment to peace, and what you can do to make a difference. This conflict is essentially about land and human rights, not religion and culture. Endorsed by Palestinian, Israeli and American scholars and peace activists.\n\nJewish Voice for Peace opposes anti-Jewish, anti-Muslim, and anti-Arab bigotry and oppression.  JVP seeks an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem; security and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians; a just solution for Palestinian refugees based on principles established in international law; an end to violence against civilians; and peace and justice for all peoples of the Middle East. Current mission statement adopted in 2009.\n\nJewish Voice for Peace is a diverse and democratic community of activists inspired by Jewish tradition to work together for peace, social justice, and human rights. We support the aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians for security and self-determination.\n\nWe seek:\n\nA U.S. foreign policy based on promoting peace, democracy, human rights, and respect for international law.\nAn end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem.\nA resolution of the Palestinian refugee problem consistent with international law and equity.\nAn end to all violence against civilians.\nPeace among the peoples of the Middle East.\nWe are among the many American Jews who say to the U.S. and Israeli governments: “Not in our names!”\n\nJVP supports peace activists in Palestine and Israel, and works in broad coalition with other Jewish, Arab-American, faith-based, peace and social justice organizations.\n\nJewish Voice for Peace calls for a U.S. foreign policy that promotes democracy and human rights. The United States must stop supporting repressive policies in Israel and elsewhere. U.S. military aid to countries in the Middle East must be based on rigorous enforcement of the Arms Export Control and Foreign Assistance Acts, which mandate that military aid may be used for only defensive purposes within the recipient country’s borders, and that aid may not be delivered to countries that abuse human rights.\n\nUnder these guidelines, U.S. military aid to Israel must be suspended until the occupation ends, since the occupation itself is in violation of these guidelines. Military aid allows Israel to avoid making serious efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as conflicts with its other neighbors. It enables the occupation, contributes to the devastation of Palestinian society and fosters the increasing militarization of Israeli society.\n\nJVP also calls for suspension of military aid to other human rights abusers and occupiers in the Middle East. This aid helps prop up autocratic and repressive regimes, promotes violations of human rights and international law, obstructs democratic movements, prolongs the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and fosters militarism and violence at home and abroad.\n\nRead our mission here:\nhttps://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/mission\n\nDownload free resources here:\nhttps://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/toolkit/\n\nMake a tax deductible donation to Jewish Voice for Peace here:\nhttps://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/donate\n\nGet independent reporting from Israel/Palestine here:\nhttp://972mag.com\n\nWatch JVP members talk about their vision for justice in Israel and Palestine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtF9_yuAnM",
